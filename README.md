Ecommerce platform java prototype
Developed a console-based E-Commerce java application that efficiently handles stock transaction while demonstrating core Java programming concepts. 
Concepts Used: 
1) Classes and Objects 
• Explanation of Product, User, Cart, Order, and EcommercePlatform as classes. 
• Use of objects as instances of these classes. 
2) Encapsulation and Access Modifiers 
• Discussion of the private and public access modifiers. 
• How encapsulation is achieved by making fields private and providing public getters and 
setters. 
3) Constructors 
• Explanation of the constructor method in each class and its purpose. 
• Use of parameterized constructors to initialize objects. 
4) Static Fields and Constants 
• Explanation of the USD_TO_INR_CONVERSION_RATE constant. 
• Why static final is used for constants. 
5) Method Overloading (Polymorphism) 
• Explanation of how polymorphism is demonstrated in the code (if applicable). 
6) Data Structures and Collections 
• Use of ArrayList to store products and users. 
• Use of HashMap to manage the cart items and products with quantities. 
7) Control Flow Statements 
• Conditional statements and loops used for iterating products, checking stock, and 
processing payment. 
8) Scanner Class for User Input 
• Explanation of the Scanner class and how it is used to gather user input for registration, 
login, adding items to cart, and payment. 
9) Exception Handling (Potential Areas for Improvement) 
• Highlighting areas where exception handling could be added for robustness, like input 
validation. 
10)   String Manipulation and Regex 
• Use of matches method for filtering products by category. 
11)   Static Methods 
• Explanation of why addSampleProducts, displayProductsBySection, and 
processPayment are static. 
12)   Packages and Imports 
• The use of oop_assignment as a package. 
• Explanation of import java.util.* to access ArrayList, HashMap, and Scanner. 
13)   File Structure of Java Projects 
• Standard structure of Java projects (src folder, packages). 
To run this code:
